Steps Before coding:
1. git reset --hard
2. git branch "%NAME%Branch"
3. git checkout "%NAME%Branch"

Steps Before working on code - will delete all code in your local branch:
1. git checkout master
2. git pull --rebase
3. git branch -D "%NAME%Branch"
4. git branch "%NAME%Branch"
5. git checkout "%NAME%Branch"
6. Start Coding!

Steps Before Pushing:
1. git commit -a
2. write a comment inside the txt file that pops up
3. git checkout master
4. git pull --rebase
5. git merge "%NAME%Branch"
6. RESOLVE MERGE CONFLICTS AND DO TESTING
7. git status
	your branch should be ahead by x commits, where x is the number of commits in the "%NAME%Branch" branch
8. git push
9. git checkout "%NAME%Branch"
10. git merge master
11. Fix Merge conflicts - should be none

If you just want to update your local branch:
1. git checkout master
2. git pull --rebase
3. git checkout "%NAME%Branch"
4. git merge master
5. Fix Merge conflicts and make sure everything works
6. Start Coding!


Rules:
1 commit per feature
TABS vs SPACES
Max_line_length
camelCase for variables, constants are all upper, functions are word1_word2 format
Comment methods as the other team did.
update the commit template with git config commit.template ~/absolute/path/to/commit_template.txt
I suggest moving the template to home (~/commit_template.txt)
